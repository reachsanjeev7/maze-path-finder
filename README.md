# maze-path-finder
user gives input nxn matrix and computer finds path from start point to end point through '.'
'.' indicates path
'#' indicates wall

maze.txt is the input i tried.

If there is a end of path, then it retraces to place where i can find another path and fills the retraced path with '#' so that it will not trace already traced path.

Tried using recursive function as well as loops.
